Story

<a name="1">`Day 1`</a>

## Halloween Night, A few hours into the night

### Night
My master recently died. He is in the morgue.
His stuff is to be transfered in the morning to the Silver Ford Enrichment Center.

`Enter Scene`

Hanging out, we hear some skittering. We investigate. Found a albino rat that can speak?? Says Master in the deep dark place wants the Shiny, but not just any shiny. It turned back into a normal rat...?

Set the Ward, with its sacrafice, against rats

`End Scene`

## Nov. 1st

### Day

contacted by Sabel (pompus cat, Jessebella the cat leader is grooming him) that a meeting is happening at the hall of argent waters (park)

### Night
Make way to the park for the meeting.

Jessebella, Sabel, and Scarlet are notable characters.

`Enter Scene`

Jessebella talks about knowing about visitors. I nod.
Pale ones come from far away deep beyond. We go to them to cut them off from the source. 

Strange to hear her speak so frankly. Though the exchange with grimm was worth the trip.

_compelled_ Yumi confronts Scarlet to dig in more

`End Scene`

Our group moves on to get closer for dreamwalking to see if the human acting odd reveals secrets, as a rat tried to get in there too.

`Enter Scene`

We need to get into the house. Grimm mentioned a hole in the ceiling, but we have more interesting ideas.

"Ozzie" shrinks. Grim and Yumi project themselves. And I do my job as warden. Thank goodness for zone invisibility!

Once "Ozzie" makes it, he begins the dream sequence.
Something about a crown being shiny?
Success on ending the nightmare!

She seemed to be holding a silver nugget?


`End Day 1`

<a name="2">`Enter Day 2`</a>

Ozzie picks up the silver, but it seems to send a shock through him! There is something supernatual about this.

Yumi investigates as an etheral cat can.
