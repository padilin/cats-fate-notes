<a name="1">`Day 1`</a>

## Halloween Night, A few hours into the night

### Night
My master recently died. He is in the morgue.
His stuff is to be transfered in the morning to the Silver Ford Enrichment Center.

`Enter Scene`

Hanging out, we hear some skittering. We investigate. Found a albino rat that can speak?? Says Master in the deep dark place wants the Shiny, but not just any shiny. It turned back into a normal rat...?

Set the Ward, with its sacrafice, against rats

`End Scene`

## Nov. 1st

### Day

contacted by Sabel (pompus cat, Jessebella the cat leader is grooming him) that a meeting is happening at the hall of argent waters (park) ~ 11 pm

### Night
Make way to the park for the meeting.

Jessebella, Sabel, and Scarlet are notable characters.

`Enter Scene`

Jessebella talks about knowing about visitors. I nod.
Pale ones come from far away deep beyond. We go to them to cut them off from the source. 

Strange to hear her speak so frankly. Though the exchange with grimm was worth the trip.

_compelled_ Yumi confronts Scarlet to dig in more

`End Scene`

Our group moves on to get closer for dreamwalking to see if the human acting odd reveals secrets, as a rat tried to get in there too.

`Enter Scene`

We need to get into the house. Grimm mentioned a hole in the ceiling, but we have more interesting ideas.

"Ozzie" shrinks. Grim and Yumi project themselves. And I do my job as warden. Thank goodness for zone invisibility!

Once "Ozzie" makes it, he begins the dream sequence.
Something about a crown being shiny?
Success on ending the nightmare!

She seemed to be holding a silver nugget?


`End Day 1`

`Enter Day 2`</a>

Ozzie picks up the silver, but it seems to send a shock through him! There is something supernatual about this that feels wrong.

Yumi investigates as an etheral cat can.

After a large noise from investigating, everyone meets back outside.
We pass around the silver chunk to all check what it is.

Yumi uses her seeker knowledge. blah blah lots of improv. Pitch black. Only sounds. Echos, rats, water dropping, steps into a cracking sound. A light emerges as a figure grabs you and 3 others off a bone mite pedestal.

Wow what a vision. This is bigger. We need to talk to Jessebella now.

Exit scene right to find her.

`End Scene`

She isn't too difficult to find. She doesn't move too far. And who can miss Sabel's yapping. She is just north of the halls of argent water meeting area in the park.

`Start Scene`

We had to mess with Sabel to get him to touch it.

Jessabella does indeed agree this is part of the overall issue. Asking if there is any other information. Also advise we go to Blue Moon Woods to talk to the Owl Haranomus. This is not something she can handel, please take care of this.

`End Scene`

"Ozzy" knows of a kitten who spends their time in the woods. They come into town because they arn't good at hunting yet. They do have a knack for finding things in the air. They know of a ritual to summon the Owl. Location in a clearing with a stump and 3 rocks. With a small animal sacrafice, dab blood on middle, left, right then scratch bark to summon an owl.

2 am

`Enter Scene`

Beautiful brown and red leaves. Thought the crunch is annoying. Full moon lights up the area.

As we walk, a frog jumps and accidently lands on Grimm's back. We have our sacrafice. 

The ritual ensues.

He does show up in short order! 
(Might be jessabella in an owl outfit...)

We begin introductions and the reason for our visit.

He must do research on the nugget. Nugget on stump.

He touches it and clearly unpleseant, but he continues to observe. 

To get his info we must grab him some mushrooms from the edge of the forest that are only identifiable in the twilight. where they glow

Yumi pushes her luck by asking what secrets his home might hold. The Millennium Tree!
She does manage to fluster him with her questions. Slick

Grimm complains about old eyes and young ones should look for mushrooms, Ozzie makes sure to ~drag~ assist grim

`End Scene`

We search. And before dawn, as we walk, there is an onimous glow. Its not mushrooms...
It's almost like the air itself is glowing.

The air grows thicker. Fog quickly rolls in.

Through the fog we see a particulary Meaty Mushroom growing at the base of a maple tree.

*HOWL*

Supernatural Hound appears guarding the mushrooms.

`Start Scene`

Ozzie Volunteers to grab the mushroom.

I cat air walk up to a tree and start pelting the ghost hound with acorns to distract him.

Ozzie bolts for the mushrooms.

Big O O F, the hound catches Ozzie with a good chomp on the leg before disappearing in the light of the sun's rays.

Ozzie puts on a brave face and manages to walk. A bit of a limp.
Grimm does try and help, pulling on their knowledge of random books, patch the leg up at least partially.

`End Scene`

We proceed back to the stump.

The offering is set

`Start Scene`

Grimm questions the Owl about the ghostly hound. Do you know what we had to deal with!

Owl knew about the spirit.

We give him the mushroom and he returns with a dried mushroom. The spores intereact with the nugget...?

Owl touches the nugget and he glows out his eyes for a while.

He looks very puzzled look on his face upon his mental return.

The Mine is the source of this. Scittering of rats, clanking, and more. There appears to be some great spirit collecting evil upon this. No idea how to deal with this. Perhaps something will happen if all 4 are gathered.

`End Scene`

We decide to go home and rest/clean up.

We will meet again at the park at night.

Ozzie does spend some time in the day gathering info about the mines from other cats.

`End Day 2`

`Enter Day 3`

Ozzie delays his leg healing in order to save a cat in his territory. Happens to get good information about mines tied to scarlet's burden in the burnt place.

Night
We meet at the park and with the news, we head to the burnt place.

Scarlet is here and very Scarlet. She seems to be judging if we have the right to talk to the ghost.

She decides (she's curious) we are worthy. We meet the miner who tells us about his families mines. Grandpapy was killed by jealous miners working for him. Could it be the soul of those?
The map burnt up, but Scarlet memeorized it. She decides to guide us.

Off we go!

Bridge is the way across the river. I cat walk, but the others must cross this rickity old and trecherous side.
Seems to have a large bat on the bridge... But we all made it, yumi stylishly take out the bat as she crosses.

THE MINE IS CURSED AND EVIL, I FEEL LIKE A DOG IS BREATHING ON MY NECK
Something is off. All are shook.
 `End Day 3`
